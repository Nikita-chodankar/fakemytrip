What we took, changed, and why it’s better !!
We stole the concept of a travel booking site and flipped it into its opposite: a satirical, non-functional parody called FakeMyTrip. Instead of helping users plan real vacations, we generate absurd fake itineraries to destinations like Hogwarts, Haunted Goa, and the Bermuda Triangle complete with chaotic booking details.
We replaced real reviews with fictional ones from ghosts, aliens, and time travelers. The site uses ransom-note typography, sticker-style icons, and a red-yellow-black palette to embrace the anti-hackathon’s mischievous tone.



Why it is better:
Broader scope: turns one-off fake confirmations into a cohesive parody product.
Sharper critique: the visual and content choices underline the commentary about authenticity in travel marketing.
Faster to load, easier to remix: minimal technical surface makes it simple for others to fork and extend.



Built with : HTML , CSS , No frameworks, no back-end — intentionally minimal.



Visual style and tone
Typography: ransom-note inspired typography to create a collage, rebellious look.
Iconography: sticker-style visuals to underline the parody.
Color palette: single dominant background color (red or yellow) with black accents to maintain high-contrast, punchy visuals.
Tone: mischievous and unapologetic, but clearly satirical and non-deceptive.
